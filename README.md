# 📊 Tidy Data Project

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is part of the *Elements of Computing II Portfolio Update 2* and demonstrates the principles of **tidy data** using Python. The primary goal is to clean, reshape, and visualize data to ensure that:
- ✅ Each variable has its own column.
- ✅ Each observation forms its own row.
- ✅ Each type of observational unit is stored in a separate table.

By applying these principles, we ensure that data is structured in a way that facilitates analysis and visualization.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project represents **Federal R&D Budgets** over multiple years and their relationship with GDP.

- 📌 **Source:** Adapted from Github [https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2019/2019-02-12]
- 🔍 **Pre-processing Steps:**
  - Removed unnecessary columns and missing values.
  - Reshaped the data to ensure it follows tidy data principles.
  - Standardized column names and transformed values where needed.

## 📊 Visual Examples
This project includes multiple visualizations:
1. 📈 **R&D Budget Trends as % of GDP** - A line chart showing how department-wise budgets compare to GDP over time.
2. 📊 **Total R&D Spending vs. GDP** - A dual-axis plot comparing the total budget with GDP growth.
